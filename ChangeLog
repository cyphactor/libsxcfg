* source:trunk/src/sxcfg.h (sxcfg_write_config): Added the prototype and documentation for the sxcfg_write_config function so that it is possible to write a configuration to a file for later reading, or reading by other applications or processes that use libsxcfg.

* source:trunk/src/sxcfg.c (sxcfg_write_config): Implemented the sxcfg_write_config() function so that users can write config files programatically.

* source:trunk/src/sxcfg.h (sxcfg_set_opt): Added the prototype and documentation for the sxcfg_set_opt() function so that it is possible to set the value of a option which has previously been appended to the config handle or loaded by the sxcfg_parse_config() function.

* source:trunk/src/sxcfg.c (sxcfg_set_opt): Implemented the sxcfg_set_opt() function so that users could set options that were either previously appended to a handle or previously loaded by the sxcfg_parse_config() function.

* source:trunk/testing/testset.c (): Added the testset.c file as a program to test the sxcfg_write_config() function and the sxcfg_set_opt() function.

* source:trunk/testing/Makefile.am (): Modified to build the testset.c file into the testset binary and mark it as a non-install binary.

* source:trunk/src/Makefile.am (): Modified the src/Makefile.am so that lib_sxcfg can be built as a Mac OS X 10.4 universal library on either a Mac OS X 10.4 machine or a Mac OS X 10.5 machine.

* source:trunk/configure.ac (): Modified the configure.ac file so that lib_sxcfg could be built as a Mac OS X 10.4 universal library on either a Mac OS X 10.4 machine or a Mac OS X 10.5 machine.

* source:trunk/testing/Makefile.am (): Modified the testing/Makefile.am file so that lib_sxcfg test applications could be built as Mac OS X 10.4 universal binaries on either a Mac OS X 10.4 or a Mac OS X 10.5 machine.
